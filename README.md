# Svelte GitHub Website

This is a basic website built using (Svelte)[https://] to show the website
in (GitHub Pages)[]. When visiting a page, it pulls in the markdown file
for that page, processes it into HTML, and puts it into the site. Therefore, you
compile your site once and just add new markdown files for the pages, posts, etc.
